# GeekDay-Lab2
In this lab we will use Python to retrieve information from the XtremIO API as well as to make changes in the array. This will illustrate the functionality DevOps teams demand from the infratructure.

# About GEEK-DAY
Geek-day is an internal initiative in my company to educate my pre-sales colleagues in new transformational technologies such as Cloud Native Applications, Agile development and DevOps. I have open-sourced the practical components of this training and made them available as repos in this Github page.
